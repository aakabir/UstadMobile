It analyses expected impact of climate change on a set of major agricultural systems at risk and makes the case for immediate implementation of no-regrets strategies which have both positive development outcomes and make agricultural systems resilient. This part describes the prospects for adaptation of these strategies in agriculture, as well as the likely impact of climate change mitigation activities related to agricultural water management. It then goes on to make a number of recommendations for improving the situation and mitigating the effects of climate change on agricultural water management.

The concept of ISFs was developed by PROLINNOVA (Promoting Local Innovation in ecologically-oriented agriculture and natural resource management), a nine-country programme, and the note also discusses how the PROLINNOVA partners, one of which was Cambodia, envisaged ISFs operating. The note is IK Notes no.85, one of a series of notes which report periodically on Indigenous Knowledge (IK) initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa and occasionally elsewhere.
