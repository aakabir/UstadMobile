Unlike other manuscript projects for which the Mughal court artists inherited a tradition of iconography and style from earlier Iranian manuscripts, they had to invent new compositions for these works.

By the turn of the century, amateurs everywhere were filling album pages with the fruits of their own labors. Mass-media imagery suited the album format just as well. Sparked by advancements in photomechanical reproduction, a profusion of new illustrated magazines began to appear just after the turn of the century. This, in tandem with a burgeoning film industry—well off the ground by 1910—wrought dramatic changes in public perceptions of fame, sophistication, and ideal beauty.\n\nGirls I Have Known, compiled by Daniel Rochford when he was sixteen, stands at the crossroads of these various cultural and technological currents. This eccentric scrapbook-filled with handwritten commentary, folded notes passed in school, and snapshot portraits—documents the \"girls\" the author has liked (and disliked), from his first kindergarten \"crushes\" to later, unrequited high-school romances. More than an example of oddball juvenilia, Girls I Have Known is a testament to photography\u0027s signal importance in the structuring of mass desire at the dawn of the media age.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"dedicated-myself","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe4f41e1f","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/m9lzVBf1Piq13oDXWgno65yIQNNSJLIHcn9ZHpSgbeDD4W_xrd70t_TRDZZK9hZl62TD1Itrp32y0fyHILLFzSwF","lastModified":1548921535897,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22472,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691446,"title":"Groom and Rider","description":"Met curator Sheila Canby on the economy of line in Groom and Rider from Tabriz, Iran, 1540–50.\n\nThe subject of horseman and groom is common in Safavid art.

The Crucifixion is presented as an eyewitness account set against a distant landscape, astonishing for its depth and subtlety of description. By contrast, the Last Judgment is organized hieratically in three tiers, with the scale of the figures manipulated to indicate their relative importance.

It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sithathoryunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: \"The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].\"\n\nThis cloisonné pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning \"encircled,\" thus declaring the solar deity\u0027s supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khakheperre. Flanking the king\u0027s name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning \"life\") suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons\u0027 heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing \"millions of years.\" Thus the king\u0027s life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.\n\nJewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was not simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.\n\nSince the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Graff on life force in Two Panels with striding lions from Babylon, c. 604–562 B.C.E.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire fell before the combined onslaughts of Babylonians and Medes in 614 and 612 B.C. In the empire\u0027s final days, Nabopolassar (r. 625–605 B.C.), who had been in Assyrian service, established a new dynasty with its capital in Babylon. During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar\u0027s ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for the control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem. During this period Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building and Babylon became a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city\u0027s gates and buildings. \n\nThe most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or \"House of the New Year\u0027s Festival.\" The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of the weather god Adad and of Marduk.

The oval reliefs show the Justice of Trajan (right) and Alexander the Great and Hephaestion at the tent of Darius (left). Hephaestion\u0027s friendship with Alexander (who happened to share a first name with Menshikov) is meant to underscore Menshikov\u0027s service to his master and close friend, Peter the Great. After the emperor\u0027s death in 1725, his widow, Catherine, assumed power and virtually entrusted Menshikov with ruling Russia.

Whatever the age of the owner at her death, she was given a youthful countenance for the eternal afterlife. The shape of the face, with its long slender nose, sloe eyes, and sensuous mouth, identifies it as a product of the latter half of the Amarna period. The jar and lid were altered in antiquity, making it extremely difficult to identify the original owner.\n\nThe striking face carved on the jar lid represents one of the royal women of Amarna. Her hairstyle of overlapping curls, known as the Nubian wig, was worn only by adults and was popular among the female members of Akhenaten\u0027s family. The hole at the center of the forehead once secured the separately carved upper body of a rearing cobra whose tail is visible across the top of the wig. This royal protector was exclusively worn by kings and queens. Since its discovery in 1907, the face has been variously identified as that of Queen Tiye, Akhenaten\u0027s mother; Queen Nefertiti, his principal wife; Queen Kiya, his beloved secondary wife; and Princess Merytaten, his eldest daughter. For a time, it was even identified as Akhenaten himself. This confusion is understandable, since the inscription identifying the owner was almost completely erased. Faint traces of hieroglyphs indicate that the jar was originally inscribed for Kiya, and the Nubian wig is most frequently associated with this queen. In some respects, however, the face more closely resembles later representations of Tiye, and it is possible that the lid originally belonged to her burial equipment and was later placed on Kiya\u0027s canopic jar.\n\nThe tomb in which the jar was found, KV 55 in the Valley of the Kings, is probably the most controversial of all Egyptian tombs. It contained burial equipment inscribed for Queen Tiye and magical bricks with the name of Akhenaten. There were also four canopic jars (including this one) and an inlaid wooden coffin almost certainly made for Kiya. It appears that, for safekeeping, Tutankhamun had this material transferred to Thebes from Akhenaten\u0027s tomb at Amarna, which seems to have been plundered soon after Akhenaten\u0027s death. The jars and coffin of Kiya may have been reused at that time for the burial of another member of the royal family.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Back in New York, following his service in the army (ca. 1950–51), Johns became acquainted with artist Robert Rauschenberg, composer John Cage, and dancer Merce Cunningham. By the mid- to late 1950s Johns had already achieved fame with his paintings of targets, numerals, and American flags, and his work was exhibited in prominent museums and galleries in New York. \"White Flag\" of 1955, recently acquired by the Metropolitan from the artist\u0027s own collection, exemplifies Johns\u0027s early style, which engendered a wide range of subsequent art movements, among them Pop Art, Minimal Art, and Conceptual Art. During the 1950s and 1960s Johns frequently appropriated well-known images (such as targets, flags, and beer cans), elevating them to cultural icons. Throughout his oeuvre — which includes painting, prints, drawings, and sculpture — images are constantly recycled and combined in extensive series. In his later compositions of the 1970s, Johns filled the surface of his pictures with colorful cross-hatchings (suggested by the passing cars on an expressway); and since the 1980s he has incorporated images that have more autobiographical significance.\n\n\"White Flag\" is the largest of his flag paintings and the first in which the flag is presented in monochrome. By draining most of the color from the flag but leaving subtle gradations in tone, the artist shifts our attention from the familiarity of the image to the way in which it is made. \"White Flag\" is painted on three separate panels: the stars, the seven upper stripes to the right of the stars, and the longer stripes below. Johns worked on each panel separately. After applying a ground of unbleached beeswax, he built up the stars, the negative areas around them, and the stripes with applications of collage—cut or torn pieces of newsprint, other papers, and bits of fabric. He dipped these into molten beeswax and adhered them to the surface. He then joined the three panels and overpainted them with more beeswax mixed with pigments, adding touches of white oil.\n\nThe fast-setting medium of encaustic enabled Johns to make each brushstroke distinct, while the forty-eight-star flag design—contiguous with the perimeters of the canvas— provided a structure for the richly varied surface, which ranges from translucent to opaque.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"below-the-surface","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x876db2db","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/jsDARZEP0Ax137Qp-WeMX2w_e3IkHbu_jh6vyA07HScrRPp77wU_trgSXFZZPgCvc9coJi2UbGIJOhSxVlcTqV24","lastModified":1548921542334,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22520,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691010,"title":"Topic A: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 4th Grade, Module 6 Topic A","entryId":"4th-m6-ta-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/4th-grade-foundations-engageny/4th-m6-engage-ny-foundations#4th-m6-ta-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921616441,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22910,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691397,"title":"Helmschmid, Portions of a costume armor","description":"Met curator Pierre Terjanian on illusion in Kolman Helmschmid’s Portions of a costume armor, c. 1525.\n\nThis armor reproduces in steel the extravagant puffed and slashed costume of the German Landsknechte (mercenary infantry troops).

The rim of the roundel, consisting of eighteen thumbnail-shaped cells for turquoise inlay in the manner of some Sarmatian roundels, frames the openwork figure of an eagle in high relief. Grasping a small, crouching animal in its talons, the bird perches in three-quarter view, facing right, with its chest extended and the rest of its body receding into the background. Its wings are outspread, the one on the left seen emerging from behind the swelling of the chest and the one on the right receding into the back plane. The body and legs carry ridges and linear patterning to suggest the texture of feathers. The bird\u0027s head is in profile, with a cell for the prominent ear, a protrusion at the eye area, a curved beak, and a downcurved line for the mouth. The entire figure is worked in the round, although the back is distorted and not as carefully finished as the front. The eagle\u0027s prey has been variously identified as an antelope, a goat, and a hare. Turquoise is inlaid in its large ear and in several places on its body. The tabs on either side of the roundel have cells for inlays at the corners in the form of debased acanthus leaves.\n\nThis piece is one of a pair; its mate, in the British Museum, London, depicts an eagle facing the opposite way. It was thought by Ernst Herzfeld to be part of a treasure found in 1910–11 in a chamber tomb near Nihavend in Iran. Herzfeld speculated that this trove had belonged to an aristocratic Parthian family and had originally included a group of Roman gold coins of the first to second century C.E. that surfaced independently in modern times. Another related piece of jewelry, found in excavations at Dalverzin Tepe in Iran, can be dated archaeologically to the first century C.E.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.  \n\nAre you an educator?

In Peru, nose ornaments became less fashionable in the second half of the first millennium A.D. and were seldom used after about 600. This elegant, very delicate crescent nose ring from northern Peru is evidence of the high level of craftsmanship that existed among metalworkers at this time. Depicted are four spiders sitting in their web. The openwork, lacelike quality of the object was achieved by fusing the many minute parts together to create a symmetrical composition. The stylized spiders, their tiny eyes and fangs showing, are held, each in its own open space, by paired, spindly legs echoing the round bodies and joined to the web. Spider imagery occurs in Peruvian art from the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. onward, suggesting that spiders played a role in early Andean mythology. The spiders\u0027 ability to catch and kill live prey associates them with sacrifice. Information from the sixteenth-century Inka peoples links spiders with rainfall and fertility.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

He began his design career in the 1930s. It peaked between the late 1940s and mid- 1950s, when his scarce and highly original gowns were sought after by society\u0027s most prominent women. Personally draping and constructing the garments that bear his label, he is considered to be the only American to work in the true couture tradition. James saw himself as an artist and sculptor of dress rather than a dressmaker. He manipulated fabrics into dramatic shapes using complex seaming and sometimes complicated understructures to create his singular vision of timeless elegance. A master of the relationship between form, color and texture, he often heightened the drama of his evening wear by combining several like fabrics of different colors, or different fabrics in like colors but with different light reflective qualities. Also a perfectionist, he worked for years on refining certain seam lines, shapes and constructs that particularly expressed his vision of artistry through rigorous engineering. Many of his pieces are conceived asymmetrically and possess a sense of movement and vitality that is a signature characteristic of his work. Many historical references in shapes and construction, especially the drapery forms of the 1870s and early teens, are also prevalent throughout his work.\n\nThe construction of this dress reconfigures the body by having the harder draped fabric brought forward and soft fabric at the back, the opposite from the norm, giving the appearance of front and back being reversed. The startling color contrast and different reflective qualities of satin, wool-backed crepe and faille in the skirt reinforce this deception. The form of the hips bears witness to James\u0027 claims of being a sculptor of fabric.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"hipster","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xdf4d4d05","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/D3D47UkrtP2kyRdK2xTim8nMCLH1ZbKuBltWL5DGhYppW1fwSxOS9zDHdJ9qOSXaiNPp1fe6RxRA4Xrx8IMbP6A","lastModified":1548921547645,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22549,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691370,"title":"Documenting Conflict","description":"By its very nature, art is a kind of documentation—it reflects the society in which it was made, and the intention of the artist who created it.

Because they can bear witness to and capture life very nearly as we see it, photography has a unique relationship to reality among the arts. This can be seen in the evolution of photography from pure reportage to more creative forms of documentation. While the photographs in this exhibition serve to document and give proof to instances of conflict, very rarely do they show it explicitly: in some photos there isn’t a single weapon, just the faces of those who served as witnesses to a trauma. By showing what no longer is there, they document and immortalize the effects of violence on the landscape, human body, and psyche, from shell-shocked soldiers in Vietnam to empty fields in Flanders.\n\nPhotographs have the power to document, to capture images and the lingering effects of events on places and people.

He was one of many German exiles, including a significant number of artists, who were interned in a camp on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. During his time in the camp and for many years later, Schwitters made hundreds of portraits in an effort to earn a living and document the lives and faces of those not on the front line.\n\nAfter his release in 1941 he became closely involved with the London art scene, and continued to make portraits of those around him. Take a look at how Schwitters captured the effects of conflict on those beyond the field of battle. What role do you think artists have in documenting not just conflicts and events, but the state of society around them? \n\nLearn more about Kurt Schwitters here.\n","entryId":"kurt-schwitters-portraits","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x04e7cb02","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/VuDy9rtGakVQzBkd-0_cVR0rI0pj9zCXFfvB2WR-dpqFy-DkIi8oPfGAErDd8GS6RWklM-GCPSlqFSfC6DqAxaie2A","lastModified":1548921549124,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22557,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691362,"title":"Necessary and Sufficient Conditions","description":"Test your knowledge of the distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions!","entryId":"necessary-vs-sufficient-conditions","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe23a2223","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/BeOgMWy4wbB_Q_hya2R5VB6kM67lVZt4Kk7QK0qeQF8kNTAZdgQySmtM2CjlKCnM43zq5iJ325T-aH9yhE89dd4","lastModified":1548921549328,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22558,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691361,"title":"Mascarade à la Grecque; Suite des Vases; and [Cheminées], designed by Petitot","description":"Met curator Femke Speelberg on fantasy in Mascarade à la Grecque; Suite des Vases; and [Cheminées], designed by Ennemond Alexandre Petitot and etched and published by Benigno Bossi,  1771, 1764.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"fantasy","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xad25e7d4","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/4tDpHjfO2FMX0fksd9KgQ3P4SvOZt7FOzWHp7-pLmxYVJqGMTVbwjHwDRS09RijtcbWRIfw3-6ZXL6I9dzdETGET","lastModified":1548921549392,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22559,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691360,"title":"Fundamentals: Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value","description":"What sort of things do we value and why?

Mechanical table","description":"Met curator Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide on identity in Jean-François Oeben’s Mechanical table, c. 1761–63.\n\nLong recognized as one of Jean-François Oeben\u0027s masterpieces, this table (ca. 1761–63) was made for his frequent and most important client, Madame de Pompadour. The main charge of her coat of arms, a tower, appears at the top of the gilt-bronze mount at each corner. The marquetry of the top—one of the finest panels in all of Oeben\u0027s furniture—was designed to reflect her interests in the arts and depicts a vase of flowers as well as trophies emblematic of architecture, painting, music, and gardening. The table, completed after Oeben\u0027s death by his brother-in-law Roger Vandercruse, demonstrates Oeben\u0027s talents, not only as a creator of beautiful furniture but also as a mechanic: an elaborate mechanism allows the top to slide back at the same time as the larger drawer moves forward, thereby doubling the surface area.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Norfolk\u0027s photographs re-imagine and respond to Burke\u0027s Afghan war scenes, but are transposed into the context of contemporary conflict.\nConceived as a collaborative project with Burke across time, Norfolk’s new body of work is presented alongside Burke\u0027s original portfolios. In doing so, these photographs go beyond documentary and begin to speak not only to each other, but to their viewers in new and thought-provoking ways. Could Burke’s 150-year-old photographs have something to say about modern warfare in Afghanistan? Or could Norfolk’s new images shed light on a 19th century conflict?\n","entryId":"photographs-from-the-war-in-afghanistan","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x6ac1a2d1","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/G2-PGsELTbpS19poYGy_Op5sGJzVo8yPpNHaBtlg6zwddX0NSee0snUmc7JOxQP25-IZdfr-5T7A1WSqoIAO3AEDjQ","lastModified":1548921550852,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22562,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691356,"title":"Key Points","description":"","entryId":"women-as-artists-key-points","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x31f8ab0f","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921550904,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22562,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691345,"title":"Challenging the State","description":"With its capacity for commentary, art becomes the perfect tool for artists to create powerful visual and conceptual statements they might not be able make otherwise.

Restorations by the eighteenth-century Italian sculptor Vincenzo Pacetti: (on Dionysos) ivy wreath, neck, both arms, lower right leg, calf and boot of left leg, hanging drapery on right side; (on the archaistic image) uplifted corner of drapery, both arms, lower half of lower legs, feet, pedestal, entire base.\n\nDionysos, god of wine and divine intoxication, wears a panther skin over his short chiton and his high sandals with animal heads on the overhanging skin flaps. He stands beside an archaistic female image whose pose and dress imitate those of Greek statues carved in the sixth century B.C.E. It is difficult to know whether the original Greek bronze statue of Dionysos, of which this is a copy, included the female figure. Supports in the form of pillars, herms, and small statues were not uncommon in Classical art, but this figure may have been added to support the outstretched arm and may represent Spes, a Roman personification of Hope, who was commonly shown as an archaistic maiden.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Parker selected 38-year-old mother of two Georgina Baker as the model of her version of Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid sculpture. Danish artist Edvard Eriksen’s original was cast in 1913, and he created its dainty fairy-tale figure by fusing the physical characteristics of his wife and a ballerina. Parker, on the other hand, modelled her sculpture in the image of a real woman, casting her body in bronze with complete realism, both imbuing her figure with monumentality while turning an idealised character into a real person.\nWhat do you think Parker is encouraging us to think about with this sculpture? Is she defying the notion that only idealised female bodies have a place in art, or perhaps encouraging us to see the everyday as something more heroic?\n\nRead more about Cornelia Parker and explore her work in the Tate collection here.\n","entryId":"cornelia-parkers-folkestone-mermaid","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x34847f21","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Y4M0oSDiKmZH4KgvTxTMfS1zvBOgHAl-kxM6Pm3z09KRF0VrsS8Xxn58w37PAmH1P1it2_QdJGFGwR0f9emWS9vtuA","lastModified":1548921552386,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22573,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691344,"title":"Tiepolo, The Triumph of Marius","description":"Met curator Xavier Salomon on triumph and loss in Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s The Triumph of Marius, 1729.\n\nThis painting is from a series of ten magnificent canvases painted to decorate the main room of Ca’ Dolfin, Venice.

Visitors who expect to walk freely through the museum are presented instead with a controlled and threatening environment. In this video, the Cuban artist talks about her performance work and explains why, instead of presenting images that can be viewed at a safe distance, she wants people to personally experience the dynamics of power. Performance art has the unique power of being able to activate viewers and invite them to become part of the artwork, giving them a sense of power they might not otherwise experience in a gallery setting. But in this case Bruguera has turned performance art on its head, and instead of empowering her audience she intentionally makes them feel disempowered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat purpose do you think Bruguera’s performance serves? Is it okay for police to corral and give orders to an audience, whether they like it or not?

With this new circular form, Hammer takes film off the screen and projects it into the space an audience is in, making it necessary to move to view the film.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to pushing the boundaries of film, Hammer has pushed for acceptance of the female body and sexuality, and a break from artifice and disguise.

Silver stamps dating to 613–29/30 on the reverse of these masterpieces place their manufacture in Herakleios’s reign. The biblical figures on the plates wear the costume of the early Byzantine court, suggesting to the viewer that, like Saul and David, the Byzantine emperor was a ruler chosen by God. Elaborate dishes used for display at banquets were common in the late Roman and early Byzantine world; generally decorated with classical themes, these objects conveyed wealth, social status, and learning. This set of silver plates may be the earliest surviving example of the use of biblical scenes for such displays. Their intended arrangement may have closely followed the biblical order of the events, and their display may have conformed to the shape of a Christogram, or monogram for the name of Christ. At the top of this magnificent plate, David confronts Goliath, and between them is a personification of the river from which David gathered stones for his sling. The major scene shows the decisive battle. Although David appears to be on the defensive, his men move forward, forcing Goliath’s soldiers into retreat. At the bottom, the victorious David beheads the giant (1 Samuel 17:41–51).\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

How do you balance clarity with enough emotion with sufficient creative space?\" In another performance by Cuban artist Tania Bruguera, we are confronted with questions about immigration, nationalism, and what it means to be a citizen of the world. After lining up to visit the exhibition, some visitors are required to pass an “immigration test” and a polygraph test before being granted access to the inner gallery. Once inside, the darkened space is lit only by the sparks of a migrant worker welding a sign. The sign reads “Arbeit Macht Frei” (“work makes you free”)–the very same words that hung over the entrance to the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.\nIn this case the gallery provides a more secluded space in which to confront and contemplate issues of discrimination and nationalism.

The focal point of the painting is the tragic death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza. Abandoned by his fleeing troops, he charged the attacking column alone, fell mortally wounded, and, refusing all assistance, died near his post. Trumbull portrays him rejecting the aid of General George Eliott, commander of the British troops. This work, the largest and last of three versions of the subject that Trumbull executed between 1786 and 1789, demonstrates his ambition to solidify his reputation on the basis of the highly respected genre of history painting.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

For the past four decades Kennard has consistently challenged power structures and injustice, from his anti-nuclear works of the 1980s to the powerful images he created in response to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kennard has created a legacy of powerful work that stands as an open confrontation to political injustice. He creates montages using images of war, conflict, and what he calls “collateral damage”—usually in the form of human beings—to protest, comment, and reflect upon global conflicts. Join Kennard on a tour of his studio as he explains his work.\nPhotomontage is a technique in which two or more images are cut and joined together to create a new one.

Pop art is a movement that emerged in the 1950s -- in America, Britain, and around the world -- as a revolution against the dominant approaches to art and culture at the time. Seeing the traditional artistic methods, subjects, and media still dominant in art schools and museums, many young artists grew keenly aware of the disconnect between these established practices and the popular culture that defined their everyday lives. So they turned away from tradition and looked to Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music and comic books for their source material, creating a movement that both celebrated and critiqued the consumer culture they lived in. Join actor Alan Cumming as he whips through the history of pop art in America and Britain, from Andy Warhol to Peter Blake.\n\nCan a can of soup be a work of art?

In the 1960s, he broke with the established traditions of abstract expressionism, choosing instead to create paintings that mimicked the the techniques of printed materials (such as the famous Ben-Day dots) and drawing on popular imagery from comic strips, advertisements, and other printed sources. Lichtenstein makes us think about the paradox of being an artist -- someone who we often think of using their hands to make something -- in an age of mechanically produced and printed images. This mass production of images challenged not only the tradition of hand-painting but also the perceived originality of painters at the time, so Lichtenstein created work that both drew on and parodied popular imagery.

Through this simplification, Caulfield took ordinary images and turned them into something iconic. Join Tate Director Nicolas Serota and artist Dexter Dalwood as they share their impressions of two of Caulfield\u0027s larger works: Interior with a Picture (1985-86) and Dining Recess (1972), which despite their later creation, still have the look and feel of \u002760s pop art.\n\nWhat do you think of Caulfield\u0027s paintings?

Polke was one of the most significant German artists to emerge in the 1960s, making art in parallel to more \"mainstream\" Pop in a huge range of materials from painting, drawing and film to potatoes, bubble wrap, and arsenic-based paints. As a young man and self-professed member of a group called the Capitalist Realists, Polke created work that responded to the beginnings of consumer society and popular imagery in West Germany, painting objects like socks, shirts, and plastic tubs in vibrant colours. In the early \u002760s, Polke worked with halftone images – a printing technique using series of dots, not unlike Lichtenstein\u0027s Ben-Day dots – taken from newspapers and other popular printed matter. He later shifted to overlaying images, working with larger canvases, and making use of more unconventional materials. Through his work, Polke confronted difficult truths about the world he lived in – such as Nazism and the Berlin Wall – including those of a consumer, image-driven society.\n\nWhat do you think makes Pop art in Germany so different from more mainstream understandings of Pop, like in the US and UK?

Since the mid-1960s, her work has been exemplary of what she calls the \"other pops\", or the engagements with pop art and the ideals of the movement that were thriving beyond the US and UK at the time. Her work often sought a prominent role for women, using it as a language to reflect on what the role of women in society was in the \u002760s. Influenced by the socio-political upheavals of the time, her practice is mainly based around functional, everyday objects, like sculptures that have been made into chests of drawers. Her work Red Coat (1969) was created for improvised performances in public spaces, and presents the human body as a conceptual piece of art. Stripping its wearers of any particular identity, it immerses them in a communal performance of equality. \n\nIn this film, take a trip around the world with Nicola L\u0027s Red Coat. Do you think that Red Coat can be a work of art on its own, or does it need to be animated with people inside of it to be art? When does a body become a work of art?\n","entryId":"nicola-l","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x300c8253","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZCdwTudJg6e6n-P2gsaUborP4izvMsGo71pvEVlX9dNYWcLXcP7VHkWpn2grt4TUP1KoJLQP9NswyHBuBLSFTBw","lastModified":1548921566354,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22660,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691259,"title":"Ethics: The Problem of Moral Luck","description":"Victor Kumar (Michigan) introduces the problem of moral luck and surveys potential solutions.

In the 1960s, Saint Phalle emerged as a powerful and original figure in a highly masculine international Pop arts world. She began with highly decorative, colourful paintings before moving on to creative assemblages and landscapes using objects found throughout the household, such as toys, broken plates, and kitchen gloves. Look closely at her Self Portrait (1958), a dark and visibly tortured depiction, and you\u0027ll see that her own figure is made up of shards of glass and household trinkets. Like Nicola L and other female Pop artists around the world, Saint Phalle used her work to explore the roles of women in art in society, through pieces such as Shooting Pictures, in which she fired a .22 rifle into bags of paint strapped to a canvas, and the \"Nanas\", her bold and colourful sculptures of monstrously feminine figures.\n\nWe\u0027ve seen that Pop art was a vehicle for international and women artists to disrupt an art history that they saw as belonging to mostly male artists in a US-UK context.

For plants and animals these mostly have to do with nutrition and reproduction, and in the case of animals, pleasure and pain. For humans, these vegetative and animal capabilities are necessary but not sufficient for our flourishing. Since reason and the use of language are the unique and highest capabilities of humans, the cultivation and exercise of intellectual friendships and partnerships, moral and political virtue, scientific knowledge and (above all) theoretical philosophy, was argued by Aristotle to be the ultimate purpose of human life.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Monte Ransome Johnson,  Associate Professor, University of California San Diego","entryId":"aristotle-on-the-purpose-of-life","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x8a0d99ca","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/vBLNe5Cvc6GJZGoMZsJw8oTouqRDBiNsIOl31JUFRQzFCewtTAxRrxFdm1Ua1qoMP5Fvtmmtuq3xQ1PcWjlacpPu","lastModified":1548921580576,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22755,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691164,"title":"Epistemology: The Value of Knowledge","description":"People tend to value knowledge; it’s better to know something than just to believe it, even if your belief is correct by pure luck.

Despite society’s view at the time that he was on the edge of senility–it is said that Queen Victoria thought him quite mad–Turner still travelled extensively. He witnessed new cultures and social scenes, exhibited a supreme confidence in his tools, and created work that was so different from that of his contemporaries that they often didn’t know what to make of it.\nSome historians believe that the abstract qualities of late Turner made him a very early precursor to Modernism. Despite creating dramatic new textures and visual experiences, Turner synthesised his earlier experiences without abandoning the interests and methods of his past.

For example, how do I know that the sun will rise tomorrow? A natural answer is that we have this knowledge through induction: I know the sun will rise tomorrow, because it has risen every day in the past. Now, the philosopher David Hume recognized that this inductive reasoning assumes that the future will resemble the past. Why though think that this assumption is true? How do we know that the future will resemble the past?

Because of their age and fragility, these sketchbooks are being completely digitised as to preserve them and allow the public to view and interact with them.

Among the many in the Hutchinson internment camp was German painter and sculptor Kurt Schwitters, who continued to work despite facing difficult conditions and a lack of materials. Bolstered by the strong artistic and intellectual community that developed within the camp, Schwitters continued to paint, sculpt, and craft using materials as diverse as old wood from a piano, vinyl, and even porridge! Artistic exhibitions and even a theatre were developed in the camp, and the imprisoned artistic community flourished. By chance, art historian Klaus Hinrichsen was interned with Schwitters, and as such he produced a careful series of documents that captured their time–and Schwitters’ work–in the internment camp.\nBy a very lucky twist of fate, Schwitters was interned with not only a community of fellow artists but also a master archivist in the form of Hinrichsen, who made sure to preserve Schwitters’ work and process. This fortuitous archive remains as a testament to what artists can produce even if in confinement.

Entering Agar’s archives is almost like entering her mind, as one archivist puts it—within it you can see direct inspirations for specific works she produced throughout her lifetime. Among her sketches and drawings are the bits and pieces that littered her gallery, giving us a full picture of the materials she was engaging with.\nBut Agar’s archive includes her private correspondence as well, which allows us a look into her personal life. Among her correspondence is a series of love letters from fellow British artist Paul Nash, telling the story of their affair. What value might there be in including personal letters among an artist’s drawings and sketches? Is it simply voyeuristic, or does the intersection of these documents allow us to look at a much broader cultural history?\n\nSee more of Eileen Agar\u0027s work in the Tate collection here.\n\n\n\n\n","entryId":"eileen-agar","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe2c718c6","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Irz561S1PFGUOLYE-WU5fcvSCZYUN-qq1CO9PASqw6qbBLiWSyAFE1QBHTBVeoPrTo81uC8XKxYYHYp9FcE1CPOD","lastModified":1548921596924,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22859,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691060,"title":"Michelangelo Pistoletto","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nItalian artist and leading member of the arte povera movement  Michelangelo Pistoletto came to London to recreate a seminal 1966 performance in which he rolled a ball of newspapers through the streets of Turin, Italy.

There’s also the impossibility of the task as it is ultimately infinite—why would an artist begin an artwork that is impossible to finish and with no foreseeable end?\n","entryId":"katie-paterson","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xef6d6387","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZpC0mIMwB2-rNoemHO4PTWwNq1sMAbYvlq6LYX3vyiAcfkQrN1Wl_FzVo5lVvJDXpQS0t8UhHImFHgAlc72SJA","lastModified":1548921599802,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22876,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691032,"title":"Topic A, C, D, \u0026 E: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 3rd Grade, Module 3 Topics A, C, E, and E ","entryId":"3rd-m3-tacde-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/3rd-grade-foundations-engageny/3rd-m3-engage-ny-foundations#3rd-m3-tacde-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921602053,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22888,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533690997,"title":"Topic A: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 5th Grade, Module 1 Topic A","entryId":"5th-m1-ta-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/5th-grade-foundations-engageny/5th-m1-engage-ny-foundations#5th-m1-ta-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921624727,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22923,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533690981,"title":"Topic D: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 5th Grade, Module 2 Topic D","entryId":"5th-m2-td-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/5th-grade-foundations-engageny/5th-m2-engage-ny-foundations#5th-m2-td-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921635460,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22939,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533690966,"title":"Topic D: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 5th Grade, Module 5 Topic D","entryId":"5th-m5-td-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/5th-grade-foundations-engageny/5th-m5-engage-ny-foundations#5th-m5-td-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921644529,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22954,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533690953,"title":"Topic C: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 6th Grade, Module 3 Topic C","entryId":"6th-m3-tc-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/6th-grade-foundations-engageny/6th-m3-engage-ny-foundations#6th-m3-tc-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921654476,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22967,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691041,"title":"Do Ho Suh\u0027s memory of a staircase","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nKorean artist Do Ho Suh’s work is made based on personal memories of architectural spaces. In the case of Staircase-III, he has created an exact replica of the small, narrow staircase that connects his modern New York apartment to that of his landlord. But it also recalls the staircase in his parents’ traditional Korean house in Seoul, merging two very different memories into one object. Crafted in a light, gauzy fabric, this staircase invites us to think about the nature of transitional spaces (like staircases, bridges, and doors, connecting but also separating two spaces), transparency, light, and the ephemerality of memory.\n“The space I\u0027m interested in is not only a physical one, but an intangible, metaphorical, and psychological one,” he says. Do you think that the experience of living in Korea and moving to the United States has influenced Do Ho Suh’s relationship with art and memory?

To see if an artist’s depiction could measure up to his own experience, Verity took close look at Philip James de Loutherbourg’s 1803 painting An Avalanche in the Alps. Looking at the painting gave Verity the chance to reflect upon the memory of his own avalanche survival experience–and to point out any inconsistencies in the artist’s depiction.\nWhile the billowing clouds of snow and debris evoke the feelings of being in an avalanche, Verity rightfully points out that this painting is just an artist’s impression of such an experience. On the other hand, it is important to remember that every time we look at art we are undertaking an act of interpretation—we all bring personal experience to an artwork, and this influences the way we see and think about it. Do you think an artist capture the feeling of being somewhere without actually having been there him or herself? Does this make their work somehow less effective?
